- intercept CMD/CTRL + F to focus the search box
- provide some user-y way of describing the data source you want
- fill out the link templates for the other 25 resource types
- link entries to their respective documentation pages
- allow user to make search case sensitive
- make quotes work better (e.g. `foo bar'baz bing` currently groups as `["foo", "bar'baz bing"]` instead of `["foo", "bar'baz", "bing"]`)
- make this work:`.variant.*=Fury`
- support <, >, >=, and <=
- handle commodities (currently all of them are nested under one `trade` resource which makes searching dumb)
- handle scrolling to specific line
