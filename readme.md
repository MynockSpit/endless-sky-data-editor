Step 1: Install Node 16

**Mac/Unix**: It's strongly recommended you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node, then run `nvm install lts/gallium`.
**Window**: It's strongly recommended you use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to install Node, then run `nvm install lts/gallium`.

Step 2: Run `npm install`

Step 3: Run `npm start`

**NOTE:** The app doesn't automatically pick up changes in file paths. You must run `npm run update-data` to fetch any changes you make.
